[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)


### Tech

Todo Apps uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) - Build Mobile App in JS.
* [Realm](https://realm.io) - Realm Database is a fast, easy to use, and open source alternative to SQLite and Core Data.
